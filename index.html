		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			You're a web professional; you know how much effort it takes to host a live, public-facing website. But what about those times when you want to hack something together in a hurry -- like showing a client some preliminary wireframes, or putting up a simple "brochureware" website? Even hosting a simple static blog is easier than you think.
		</p>

		<p>		
	In this talk, we'll explore some unconventional places to host your simple, static websites -- places like Dropbox, GitHub, and Amazon's S3 service. If you're in the market for "quick and dirty", these services are both fast and grungy. And free... mostly.
